# AndroidMobileGameApp

This is a project for CSC207

This Android app generates three games with multiple levels with a scoring system.

It supports users to create accounts, sign in and resume a previous game.

It develops the sign in process entirely local to the project app, unconnected to the phone ownerâ€™s account. Kept track of three statistics for each user.

It follows and demonstrated SOLID principles and design patterns for clean and extendable codes.
